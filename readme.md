# LandVer - Land Verification System

LandVer is a decentralized protocol for land registration and verification, utilizing blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and immutable system for managing land records. The protocol facilitates land transactions and ownership verification across multiple blockchains, starting with StarkNet.

While initially built on StarkNet, LandVer is designed to be cross-chain compatible, allowing land transactions and records to be securely managed across multiple blockchains.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components:

- `frontend/`: React-based web application
- `backend/`: Node.js and Express-based API server
- `contracts/`: Solidity smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain
